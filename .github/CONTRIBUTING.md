### Ask a question ⁉️

Using n2khab and got stuck? Browse the [documentation][website] to see if you can find a solution. Still stuck? Post your question as an [issue on GitHub][new_issue]. While we cannot offer user support, we'll try to do our best to address it, as questions often lead to better documentation or the discovery of bugs.

Want to ask a question in private? Contact the package maintainer by [email][email].

### Propose an idea 💡

Have an idea for a new n2khab feature? Take a look at the [documentation][website] and [issue list][issues] to see if it isn't included or suggested yet. If not, suggest your idea as an [issue on GitHub][new_issue]. While we can't promise to implement your idea, it helps to:

* Explain in detail how it would work.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible.

See below if you want to contribute code for your idea as well.

### Report a bug 🐛

Using n2khab and discovered a bug? That's annoying! Don't let others have the same experience and report it as an [issue on GitHub][new_issue] so we can fix it. A good bug report makes it easier for us to do so, so please include:

* Your operating system name and version (e.g. Mac OS 10.13.6).
* Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
* Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

### Improve the documentation 📖

Noticed a typo on the website? Think a function could use a better example? Good documentation makes all the difference, so your help to improve it is very welcome!

#### The website

[This website][website] is generated with [`pkgdown`](http://pkgdown.r-lib.org/). That means we don't have to write any html: content is pulled together from documentation in the code, vignettes, [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) files, the package `DESCRIPTION` and `_pkgdown.yml` settings. If you know your way around `pkgdown`, you can [propose a file change](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/) to improve documentation. If not, [report an issue][new_issue] and we can point you in the right direction.

#### Function documentation

Functions are described as comments near their code and translated to documentation using [`roxygen2`](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/). If you want to improve a function description:

1. Go to `R/` directory in the [code repository][repo].
2. Look for the file with the name of the function.
3. [Propose a file change](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/) to update the function documentation in the roxygen comments (starting with `#'`).

### Contribute code 📝

## Development guidelines

### Find your way: repository structure

This is the structure of the [repo]:

```
├── inst
    └── textdata        <- Textual data delivered with the package (in vc-format).
                           They can be read into R by package functions or with
                           git2rdata::read_vc().
├── man
├── misc                <- Package-related scripts / R markdown files. Rbuild-ignored!
                           Contains a script on package management + a bookdown 
                           project to reproduce the included textual data + a 
                           script to upgrade vc-formatted files.
├── R                   <- Package functions are to be made here.
├── vignettes           <- Vignettes are to be made here.
├── DESCRIPTION
├── LICENSE
├── n2khab.Rproj        <- RStudio project file
├── NAMESPACE
└── README.md
```

### Coding tools

When writing functions for `n2khab`:

- please use `tidyverse`, `sf` and `raster` packages for data reading.
Discover the human-friendly way of coding a data processing pipeline through the use of [pipes](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/pipes.html)!
Organise data in R in a [tidy](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html#tidy-data-1) way in order to avoid troubles later on.
Recommended resources to get started are:
    - [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)
    - [Geocomputation with R](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net)
    - [R packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/) (by Hadley Wickham 2015; an extended/updated [version](https://r-pkgs.org/) is still under development)
    - `vignette("rd-formatting", package = "roxygen2")` for documentation syntax
- have a quick look at the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/).
There you see how to style object, variable and function names, as well as the documentation.
At least keep in mind: **use lower case and 'snake_case'** for object, variable and function names.
- if your function returns a dataframe, use `dplyr::as_tibble()` to return it as a tibble instead.
A tibble is a dataframe that makes working in the tidyverse a little [easier](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tibbles.html).
- functions that read or process data should return data as much as possible internationalized:
    - availability of English names for types, environmental pressures, ...
    Other languages can be accommodated as well;
    - English names for table headings (dataframe variables).


### How to contribute code? 

#### _Without_ write permissions to the [code repository][repo]

We try to follow the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) for development.

1. Fork [this repo][repo] and clone it to your computer. To learn more about this process, see [this guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/).
2. If you have forked and cloned the project before and it has been a while since you worked on it, [pull changes from the original repo](https://help.github.com/articles/merging-an-upstream-repository-into-your-fork/) to your clone by using `git pull upstream master`.
3. Open the RStudio project file (`.Rproj`).
5. Make your changes:
    * Write your code.
    * Test your code (bonus points for adding unit tests).
    * Document your code (see function documentation above).
    * Do an `R CMD check` using `devtools::check()` and aim for 0 errors and warnings.
5. Commit and push your changes.
6. Submit a [pull request](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#making-a-pull-request).

#### _With_ write permissions to the [code repository][repo]

It is wise to first think about the scope of your function (or your proposed enhancement of an exisiting one), and talk it through with other collaborators:

- functions that are of broader interest than Natura 2000, better go to [inborutils](https://inbo.github.io/inborutils/) or a separate package;
- functions that will only be relevant to a specific _N2KHAB_ project, are better developed in the project-specific repo.

For more inspiration on where to put your own function, look into the [n2khab-monitoring](https://github.com/inbo/n2khab-monitoring) repo (which centralizes planning and workflow documentation in N2KHAB monitoring).

You will want to look at the file `src/manage_package.R` to get some useful packaging commands and developing tips.

More detailed info on git workflows at INBO: <https://inbo.github.io/tutorials/tags/git/>.
See also [these git workshop materials](https://inbo.github.io/git-course/index.html).

1. Make commits (in your local clone of the remote repo on Github) _in your own git branch_, branched off from the `master` branch.
(But see this in a relative manner: exactly the same process can be repeated by someone else in turn, relative to your branch.
So '`master`' in this protocol can be replaced by another branch name!)
You can push your branch to the remote as often as you like, as it will not influence other branches (first time: do `git push -u origin yourbranchname`; afterwards `git push` suffices). It serves as a backup and enables others to work with you on that branch.
1. Meanwhile, make sure that your branch stays up to date with evolutions in `master` (i.e. in your local repo, update `master` with `git checkout master && git pull` and then, with your own branch checked out again, do `git merge --no-ff master`), in order to prevent merge conflicts with `master` later on.
At this stage, you need to resolve any merge conflicts that may arise in your own branch.
1. Propose to merge your commits into `master`: this starts with making a 'pull request' (PR; actually this is a merge request) and assign at least one reviewer before a merge can be decided. At that moment, open online discussion in the repo is possible on your changes (for other open discussion that you want to start, make an _issue_). As long as no merge is performed, more commits can be added to this PR with `git push`, e.g. to implement requested changes by others.
    - note that, if you branched off another (reference) branch than `master`, make sure to change the reference branch in the pull request (the default reference is `master`).
1. After your PR is merged, pull the reference branch (usually `master`) and clean up your local repo in order to keep up with the remote.
