## Data sources used by `n2khab` functions

Apart from a few textual datasets, provided directly with this package,
most data sources are made available through some cloud-based infrastructure.
An overview is given [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xZz9f9n8zSUxBJvW6WEFLyDK7Ya0u4iN/view).

There is a major distinction between:

- raw data, residing in a folder `n2khab_data/10_raw`, publicly available and which you need to store locally to use them;
- processed data, residing in a folder `n2khab_data/20_processed`.

While you can reproduce the processed data sources from an [R script on Github](https://github.com/inbo/n2khab-preprocessing/blob/master/src/complete_reproducible_workflow.R), this may take a long computing time in specific cases.
The processed data sources are currently shared in a private cloud storage for INBO personnel (the path on the Q-share in the referred overview).
They will also be shared publicly.
_XXX the latter is to be implemented and further referred here XXX_


## How to store the data sources

Data sources evolve, and hence, data source versions succeed one another.
To ease reproducibility, this package therefore works with _locally stored_ data sources.

The `n2khab` functions, aimed at reading these data and returning them in R in some kind of standardized way, always provide _arguments_ to specify the file's name and location -- so you can in fact freely choose these.
However, to **ease collaboration in scripting**, it is highly recommended to follow specific [data management standards for N2KHAB scripting workflows](https://github.com/inbo/n2khab-monitoring/blob/master/datamanagement.md), which are also applied in the cloud storage.
Moreover, by default the _functions assume_ these locations and filenames to make your life easier.

Summarizing, this means:

- use the data source's default ID to name both the data source specific subfolder and the data source file(s) (before the extension).
This name is version-agnostic!
Versions can however be defined and checked for in a workflow, in a specific way.
_XXX the latter is to be implemented and further referred here XXX_
- depending on the data source, its own folder is to be stored either under `n2khab_data/10_raw` or under `n2khab_data/20_processed`.
- the location of the `n2khab_data` folder is specific to your setup and always needs to be specified as a function argument.
If you are a contributor to the [n2khab-preprocessing](https://github.com/inbo/n2khab-preprocessing) git repository, you can follow its organisation and create the `n2khab_data` folder at the root of the locally cloned repo (it is git-ignored).
In a collaborative workflow it is recommended to **define a variable `datapath`** in a separate, user-specific script, 
e.g.:

    ```
    datapath <- "my/absolute-or-relative/path/to/n2khab_data"
    ```
    and feed the `datapath` variable to functions in the actual collaborative workflow.
